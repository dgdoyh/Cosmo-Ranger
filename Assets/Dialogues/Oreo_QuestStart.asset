  dialoguePhrase:
  - Hey! Why are you late?
  - Oh, Mr. Do got injured?
  - I see. So you stopped by Sand Planet to help him.
  - By the way, why does he always get injured? It's little bit weird...
  - Anyways, you didn't forget what to do, right?
  - Kill all of those annoying things.
  - There will be a tricky one this time, so be prepared.
  - Upgrading your sword will help you a lot.
  - 'Also, in this planet, you can run faster but there''s fog all around. '
  - Good luck.
