  - Hey! You're here to help me, right?
  - I got injured while carrying out my mission. Now I can't move.
  - So... Can you carry out my mission instead of me, please?
  - My mission is to kill all the zombies, and take diamonds from their dead bodies.
  - Oh, by the way, it's your first time to be here, right?
  - In this planet, you'll be healed every 10 seconds, but your maximum health gonna
